His window filled up and he never recovered", "Jimmy got help from Trevor with his DFUs. This was a mistake because he ended up with an angio inside of an angio and a random extra device. Kit was 100 percented for DFUs" ],
    good_responsesa: ["Jimmy finally found out that the 'NC' in 'NCMR' stands for 'non-conformance' and he should conform to proper manufacturing standards. His kit was flawless as a result", "Jimmy actually finished his fries today and consumed enough calories to complete his kit without error" ],

    good_responses: ["Kurt was deep in a discussion about his favorite band 'Avenged Sevenfold' when he thought about the fact that he would be NCMR'd 'sevenfold' if he wasn't careful. His audit box was good", "Kurt distracted Aiden with a diatribe on whether Clerks 1 or Clerks 2 was the superior movie and Aiden missed a cheeto crumb in Kurt's audit box"]

Kevin and Bill jumped onto Jon's kit. As everyone was boxing each other's kit, Harry had a fire on line 14.", "Justin brought a microscope out to final box and QDA'd Trevor for a dead skin cell"],
